<p>Meita began her writing career back in the 1990s as creative scriptwriter with Hard Rock FM Jakarta, a pioneer lifestyle and entertainment radio station while she was also worked as one of their Music Directors, Radio DJs, and Radio Show Producers. She has remained the front lady of Wondergel, the most influential all-girl band to emerge from the 90s underground music scene in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Early 2000 Meita moved to Bali and continued her career as a Radio DJ and Program Director at Hard Rock Radio, while she maintained her focus on writing by becoming a full-time writer for the magazines <em>The Beat. Bali </em>and <em>Let&rsquo;s Eat!</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 2008, she had built The Beat United, her own international music agency. She also worked part-time as a festival worker for events such as the Ubud Writers Festival, the Readers Festival, and Earth Day.</p>
<p>After moving to Hong Kong in 2011, Meita worked briefly as a part-time DJ and a language teacher at the Hong Kong Language Learning Center. Upon her return to Bali three years later, she wrote her debut novel, inspired by her own coming-of-age story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meita is now living in Vienna, Austria.</p>
