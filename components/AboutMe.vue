<p>Meita Kasim began writing in the 1990s as a creative scriptwriter with Hard Rock FM Jakarta, a pioneer lifestyle and entertainment radio station. At the same time, she worked as one of their Music Directors, Radio DJs, and Radio Show Producers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She has remained the front lady of Wondergel, the most influential all-girl band to emerge from the 90s underground music scene in Jakarta.</p>
<p>In early 2000 Meita moved to Bali and continued her career as a Radio DJ and Program Director at Hard Rock Radio. She maintained her focus on writing by becoming a full-time writer for the magazine&nbsp;<em>The Beat&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Let&rsquo;s Eat</em><em>!.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 2008, she had built The Beat United, her international music agency. She also worked part-time as a festival worker for events such as the Ubud Writers and Readers Festival and Earth Day.</p>
<p>After moving to Hong Kong in 2011, Meita worked briefly as a part-time DJ and a language teacher at the Hong Kong Language Learning Center. Upon her return to Bali three years later, she gathered her thoughts on her life as a teenage female rock musician in the 90s and worked on her debut novel with her colleague and editor, Dr Margie Ellery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meita is now living in Vienna, Austria.</p>
